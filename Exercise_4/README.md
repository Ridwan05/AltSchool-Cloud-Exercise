- I Used `sudo groupadd Admin` to create ~Admin~ group 
  ![groupadd](groupadd.png)
  `sudo groupadd Support` and `sudo groupadd Engineering` were used to create ~Support~ and ~Engineering~ group respectively.  
- I used `nano /etc/sudoers` to edit the content of /etc/sudoers
- added ~Admin~ group to sudoers by adding ~%Admin ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL~ to content of /etc/sudoers
   ![/etc/sudoers](etc_sudoers.png)

  ![useradd](useradd.png)
  `sudo useradd -g Support SRid` and `sudo useradd -g Engineering ERid` were used to create user ~SRid~ and user ~ERid~ in ~Support~ and ~Engineering~ group respectively.  

## Generated SSH keys for the user in the Admin group
- I used `su ARid` to switched to user ~ARid~
- `cd` to /home/ARid  
- created ~.ssh~ file
- generated ssh key with `ssh-keygen` and saved in the default folder ~/home/ARid/.ssh/id_rsa~
